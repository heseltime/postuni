# 🚀 Post City NOW?

This is a scrollytelling SPA based on the mock-up delivered by the Reporters Team to **Der Standard** on September 11, 2023, as part of the Founding Lab **IDSA (Institute of Digital Sciences Austria) x Ars Electronica** and is now developed to support the PostCity Location in Linz, Austria, for **IT-U, Interdisciplinary Transformation University Austria**.

🎯 Let's lock down a simple idea: **postuni** (can still be called IT-U) – this is about a sensible university location in line with the concept!

## 🌐 Postcity x IT-U = postuni?
